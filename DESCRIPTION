Description: A toolkit to map the scientific literature. The package contains
 functions to upload bibliometric data, to build a network of scientific paper,
 to find communities of research, to characterise the communities and to
 generate reading list of seminal papers for each communities of research. 
 With this package a researcher can b
 automatically generate reading lists.
 communities through the comparaison of paper's reference list, which ultimately
 help to make reading list for new comers into a given scientific community. In simple 
    terms, this package contains a suit of functions that permit you to 
    generate a must read list of papers in your research community.
    To achieve this, the package takes in a list of records (also called:
    papers or scientific articles) and their associated references (in other 
    words; the list of articles cited by each records in the list) and find
    how many references does each record pair have in common. This operation is
    often called bibliometric coupling.
