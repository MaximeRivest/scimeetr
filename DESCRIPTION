Description: This package helps identifying and analysing scientific
    communities through the comparaison of paper's reference list, which ultimately help to make reading list for new comers into a given scientific community. In simple 
    terms, this package contain a suit of functions that permit you to 
    generate a must read list of papers in your research community.
    To achieve this, the package takes in a list of records (also called:
    papers or scientific articles) and their associated references (in other 
    words; the list of articles cited by each records in the list) and find
    how many references does each record pair have in common. This operation is
    often called bibliometric coupling.
