\title{Characterize words found within papers' abstract}
\usage{
characterize_ab(scimeetr_data, lambda = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{scimeetr_data}{An object of class scimeetr.}

\item{lambda}{A number from 0 to 1. 0 for relative frequency 1 for total 
occurence only}
}
\value{
A list of dataframe. The list length matchs the number of communities
  that the scimeetr object contains.
}
\description{
\code{characterize_ab} calculates several abstract-word metrics from a
scimeetr object. The results are returned in a list of data frame. The
metrics in the table are: abstract-words frequency, abstract-words relative
frequency, abstract-words relevance.
}
\examples{
# Example with an object of class scimeetr (see import_wos_files() or 
# import_scopus_files()) already in the workspace
abstractword_list <- characterize_ab(scimeetr_list)
# Since this example shows how to load WOS from your system we need to run 
# the following line to find the path to the exemple file
fpath <- system.file("extdata", package="scimeetr") 
fpath <- paste(fpath, "/wos_folder/", sep = "") 
# Then we can run the actual example
example_scimeetr_object <- import_wos_files(files_directory = fpath)
characterize_ab(example_scimeetr_object)
