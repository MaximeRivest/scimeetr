\title{Characterize journals.}
\usage{
characterize_jo(scimeetr_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{scimeetr_data}{An object of class scimeetr.}
}
\value{
A list of dataframe. The list length match the number of communities 
  of the scimeetr object.
}
\description{
\code{characterize_jo} calculates several journal bibliometrics from a 
scimeetr object. The results are returned in a list of data frame. The 
metrics in the table are: number of citations, H-index, impact factor, number
of different papers that were cited by papers in the scimeetr dataframe and 
others.
}
\examples{
# Example with an object of class scimeetr (see import_wos_files() or 
# import_scopus_files()) already in the workspace
journals <- characterize_jo(scimeetr_list)
# Since this example shows how to load WOS from your system we need to run 
# the following line to find the path to the exemple file
fpath <- system.file("extdata", package="scimeetr") 
fpath <- paste(fpath, "/wos_folder/", sep = "") 
# Then we can run the actual example
example_scimeetr_object <- import_wos_files(files_directory = fpath)
characterize_jo(example_scimeetr_object)
