\title{Characterize bibliometric corpus with universities.}
\usage{
characterize_un(scimeetr_data, lambda = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{scimeetr_data}{An object of class scimeetr.}

\item{lambda}{A number from 0 to 1. If 0 the relevance score would be equal 
to the relative frequency. If 1 for the relevance score would be equal to
the frequency.}
}
\value{
A list of dataframe. The list length matchs the number of communities
  that the scimeetr object contains.
}
\description{
\code{characterize_un} calculates several university bibliometrics from a 
scimeetr object. The results are returned in a list of data frame. The 
metrics in the table are: frequency, relative frequency and relevance.
}
\examples{
# Example with an object of class scimeetr (see import_wos_files() or 
# import_scopus_files()) already in the workspace
universities <- characterize_un(scimeetr_list)
# Since this example shows how to load WOS from your system we need to run 
# the following line to find the path to the exemple file
fpath <- system.file("extdata", package="scimeetr") 
fpath <- paste(fpath, "/wos_folder/", sep = "") 
# Then we can run the actual example
example_scimeetr_object <- import_wos_files(files_directory = fpath)
characterize_un(example_scimeetr_object)
