\usage{
scilist(scimeetr_data, reading_list = "core_papers", k = 5, m = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{scimeetr_data}{An object of class '\link{scimeetr}'}

\item{reading_list}{A vector of length one. Equal to either: 'core_papers', 
'core_yr', 'core_residual', 'by_expert_LC', 'by_expert_TC', 
'group_of_experts_TC', 'group_of_experts_LC', 'cite_most_others', 
'direct_cite_eigen', 'betweeness', 'closeness', 'connectness', 
'link_strength', 'page_rank', 'journal_dis'}

\item{k}{Length of list per community}

\item{m}{Not always used. \code{m} is used when there is a two step filter. 
An example of a two step filter is the list generated when reading_list = 
'by_expert'. First k will determine how many experts should be listed, then
m will determine how many papers per experts should be listed.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
\code{scilist} ranks papers according to different metrics. The metric is 
determined by the argument 'reading_list'.
}
\details{
With the parameter reading_list, we can get any of the following 12 reading 
lists that fits into three categories: \itemize{ \item Core \itemize{ \item 
core_papers \item core_yr \item core_residual } \item Experts \itemize{ \item
by_expert_LC \item by_expert_TC \item group_of_experts_TC \item 
group_of_experts_LC } \item Centrality \itemize{ \item cite_most_others \item
betweeness \item closeness \item connectness \item page_rank } }

Using \code{scilist} with reading_list = "core_papers" will list the most 
cited paper. The parameter k controls the number of paper to list.

Using \code{scilist} with reading_list = "core_yr" will list the most cited 
paper for each year from three years before present to ten years before 
present. The parameter k controls the number of paper per year to list.

Using \code{scilist} with reading_list = "core_residual" will list the papers
that diverge most from the expected number of citation for this particular 
paper.

Using \code{scilist} with reading_list = "by_expert_LC" we will get a list of
recent papers by one or a few experts in the community. For the option 
by_expert_LC, authors are ranked based on their harmonic local H-index. The 
H-index is a measure of an other productivity and impact. An author with an 
H-index of 10 means that he has published at least 10 papers with 10 or more 
citation each. A local H-index means that only citations from other papers in
the community are counted. A harmonic local H-index means that authors do not
get the full credit for each citation their paper received. It is corrected 
depending on the authos position in the authors list. First authors gets most
of the credit, then the last author gets the second most, and the authors 
gets credit as a proportion of their position. Once the authors 
harmonic-local-H-index is found they are ranked and the m most recent 
publication of the k most 'expert' authors are listed as a reading list.

Using \code{scilist} with reading_list = "by_expert_TC" instead of 
reading_list = "by_expert_LC", notice the _TC instead of the _LC will based 
the ranking calculation on total citation of it's publications instead of 
only the local citations.

Using \code{scilist} with reading_list = "group_of_experts_LC" we will get a 
list of papers for which many authors are experts in the community. For this 
option, authors are assigned a harmonic local H-index like described in the 
previous section. But this time, a weighted sum of the harmonic-local-H-index
of each authors of a paper is calculated.

Betweeness measures the importance of a paper in connecting two clusters of 
papers. Papers with a high betweeness would therefore be a paper that tend to
be more interdisciplinary.

Closeness measures the average number of link between a paper and all other 
papers. Papers with a high closeness would therefore be a paper that tend to 
have a large and wide list of citations.

Connectness measures the number of links a paper has. Papers with a high 
connectness would therefore be a paper that tend to have cited what most 
other studies cited.

With the option cite_most_others, the papers that cite most other papers of
the community can be found. This is not a centrality measure but it is also
based on papers connection to each other. It should tend to find litterature
review and recent papers that have an especially good grasp on the community.
