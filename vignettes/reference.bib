  abstract = {Article impact is becoming an increasingly popular metric for assessing a scholar's influence, yet little is known about its properties or the factors that affect it. This study tests whether author, article, and methodological attributes influence the impact of SMJ articles, defined as summed counts of article citations. Findings reveal that authors having fewer, more-often cited articles tended to have SMJ articles that received the most citations. In addition, whether an article appears in a regular or a special issue is not a stable predictor of its impact. Moreover, empirical articles that test primary data, control for more threats to internal validity, and have higher statistical power tend to receive more citations. Further, an article's long-term impact oftentimes becomes apparent shortly after its publication. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the determinants of impact and its temporal qualities and help explain some of the differences between high and average impact articles. The findings also underscore the need for transparency between author publication strategies (article volume, impact) and the requirements of his/her institution. Implications for authors, reviewers, editors, and administrative evaluation are offered. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {* 1Once neglected, the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities has received considerable attention in the last two decades, and is now widely recognized. It is timely to consider the progress made by research in this field.
* 2We review the development of plant facilitation research, focusing on the history of the field, the relationship between plant–plant interactions and environmental severity gradients, and attempts to integrate facilitation into mainstream ecological theory. We then consider future directions for facilitation research.
* 3With respect to our fundamental understanding of plant facilitation, clarification of the relationship between interactions and environmental gradients is central for further progress, and necessitates the design and implementation of experiments that move beyond the clear limitations of previous studies.
* 4There is substantial scope for exploring indirect facilitative effects in plant communities, including their impacts on diversity and evolution, and future studies should connect the degree of non-transitivity in plant competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative promotion of species coexistence, and explore how the role of indirect facilitation varies with environmental severity.
* 5Certain ecological modelling approaches (e.g. individual-based modelling), although thus far largely neglected, provide highly useful tools for exploring these fundamental processes.
* 6Evolutionary responses might result from facilitative interactions, and consideration of facilitation might lead to re-assessment of the evolution of plant growth forms.
* 7Improved understanding of facilitation processes has direct relevance for the development of tools for ecosystem restoration, and for improving our understanding of the response of plant species and communities to environmental change drivers.
* 8Attempts to apply our developing ecological knowledge would benefit from explicit recognition of the potential role of facilitative plant–plant interactions in the design and interpretation of studies from the fields of restoration and global change ecology.
* 9Synthesis: Plant facilitation research provides new insights into classic ecological theory and pressing environmental issues. Awareness and understanding of facilitation should be part of the basic ecological knowledge of all plant ecologists.},

  abstract = {We introduce a heuristic model for studying the evolution of ecological ideas based on Thomas Kuhn's concept of the development of scientific paradigms. This model is useful for examining processes leading to ecological progress and the elaboration of ecological theories. Over time, ecological knowledge diverges and evolves as data are collected that either refute or support the current trajectories of accepted paradigms. As a result, the direction of ecological research continuously branches out into new domains leading to increased ecological understanding. Unfortunately, heightened ecological understanding also builds impediments to future progress. Increased specialization and the parallel evolution of seemingly independent subdisciplines generally compel researchers to become increasingly canalized. Specialization also accelerates the expansion of the ecological literature, making it difficult for researchers to track developments in their own subdisciplines, let alone the general field of ecology. Furthermore, specialization inherently focuses attention on contemporary research and hastens the erasure of memory of historical contributions to modern ecology. As a result, contemporary ecologists are in danger of losing touch with their historical roots and face a greater likelihood of recycling ideas and impeding real scientific momentum. Enhancing our historical perspective on the evolution of ecological ideas will be key in overcoming the negative consequences of progress and safeguarding the continued advancement of ecology.},

  abstract = {* Extensive research shows that more species-rich assemblages are generally more productive and efficient in resource use than comparable assemblages with fewer species. But the question of how diversity simultaneously affects the wide variety of ecological functions that ecosystems perform remains relatively understudied. It presents several analytical and empirical challenges that remain unresolved. In particular, researchers have developed several disparate metrics to quantify multifunctionality, each characterizing different aspects of the concept and each with pros and cons.

* We compare four approaches to characterizing multifunctionality and its dependence on biodiversity, quantifying (i) magnitudes of multiple individual functions separately, (ii) the extent to which different species promote different functions, (iii) the average level of a suite of functions and (iv) the number of functions that simultaneously exceeds a critical threshold.

* We illustrate each approach using data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment and the R multifunc package developed for this purpose, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and implement several methodological improvements.

* We conclude that an extension of the fourth approach that systematically explores all possible threshold values provides the most comprehensive description of multifunctionality to date. We outline this method and recommend its use in future research.},

  abstract = {The conceptual structure of the field of Animal Science (AS) research is examined by means of a longitudinal science mapping analysis. The whole of the AS research field is analysed, revealing its conceptual evolution. To this end, an automatic approach to detecting and visualizing hidden themes or topics and their evolution across a consecutive span of years was applied to AS publications of the JCR category ‘Agriculture, Dairy \& Animal Science’ during the period 1945–2011. This automatic approach was based on a coword analysis and combines performance analysis and science mapping. To observe the conceptual evolution of AS, six consecutive periods were defined: 1945–1969, 1970–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2005 and 2006–2011. Research in AS was identified as having focused on ten main thematic areas: ANIMAL-FEEDING, SMALL-RUMINANTS, ANIMAL-REPRODUCTION, DAIRY-PRODUCTION, MEAT-QUALITY, SWINE-PRODUCTION, GENETICS-AND-ANIMAL-BREEDING, POULTRY, ANIMAL-WELFARE and GROWTH-FACTORS-AND-FATTY-ACIDS. The results show how genomic studies gain in weight and integrate with other thematic areas. The whole of AS research has become oriented towards an overall framework in which animal welfare, sustainable management and human health play a major role. All this would affect the future structure and management of livestock farming.},

In this article, I propose a method of searching the literature by systematically mining the various types of citation relationships between articles. I then test the method by comparing its precision and recall to that of 14 published systematic reviews. The method successfully retrieved 74\% of the studies included in these reviews and 90\% of the studies it could reasonably be expected to retrieve. The method also retrieved fewer than half of the total number of publications retrieved by these reviews and can be performed in substantially less time. This suggests that the proposed method offers a promising complement to traditional text-based methods of literature identification and retrieval for systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {The idea of constructing science maps based on bibliographic data has intrigued researchers for decades, and various techniques have been developed to map the structure of research disciplines. Most science mapping studies use a single method. However, as research fields have various properties, a valid map of a field should actually be composed of a set of maps derived from a series of investigations using different methods. That leads to the question of what can be learned from a combination—triangulation—of these different science maps. In this paper we propose a method for triangulation, using the example of water science. We combine three different mapping approaches: journal–journal citation relations (JJCR), shared author keywords (SAK), and title word-cited reference co-occurrence (TWRC). Our results demonstrate that triangulation of JJCR, SAK, and TWRC produces a more comprehensive picture than each method applied individually. The outcomes from the three different approaches can be associated with each other and systematically interpreted to provide insights into the complex multidisciplinary structure of the field of water research.},

Then we construct a simulated data streaming function and introduce a learning process to train a relationship identification function to adapt to changing environments in real time, where relationships of topic evolution, fusion, death, and novelty are identified. The main result of the method is a map of scientific evolutionary pathways. The visual routines provide a way to indicate the interactions among scientific subjects and a version in a series of time slices helps further illustrate such evolutionary pathways in detail. The detailed outline offers sufficient statistical information to delve into scientific topics and routines and then helps address meaningful insights with the assistance of expert knowledge. This empirical study focuses on scientific proposals granted by the United States National Science Foundation, and demonstrates the feasibility and reliability.

Co-citation networks are decomposed into co-citation clusters. The interpretation of these clusters is augmented by automatic cluster labeling and summarization. The method focuses on the interrelations between a co-citation cluster's members and their citers. The generic method is applied to a three-part analysis of the field of Information Science as defined by 12 journals published between 1996 and 2008: 1) a comparative author co-citation analysis (ACA), 2) a progressive ACA of a time series of co-citation networks, and 3) a progressive document co-citation analysis (DCA).

We use the results of a large evaluation study of 147 university chemistry research groups in the Netherlands covering the work of about 700 senior researchers during the period 1991-2000. Thus, we deal with research groups rather than individual scientists, as we consider the research group as the most important work floor unit in research, particularly in the natural sciences. Furthermore, we restrict the citation period to a three-year window instead of life time counts in order to focus on the impact of recent work and thus on current research performance. Results show that the h-index and our bibliometric crown indicator both relate in a quite comparable way with peer judgments. But for smaller groups in fields with less heavy citation traffic the crown indicator appears to be a more appropriate measure of research performance.},

For this purpose, from 6 selected subject fields (condensed matter physics, inorganic and nuclear chemistry, electric and electronic engineering, biochemistry and molecular biology, physiology, and gastroenterology), original articles published in the same year were sampled (n = 230–240 for each field). Then, the citation counts received by the articles in relatively long citation windows (6 and 11 years after publication) were predicted by negative binomial multiple regression (NBMR) analysis for each field. Various article features about author collaboration, cited references, visibility, authors' achievements (measured by past publications and citedness), and publishing journals were considered as the explanatory variables of NBMR. Some generality across the fields was found with regard to the selected predicting factors and the degree of significance of these predictors. The Price index was the strongest predictor of citations, and number of references was the next. The effects of number of authors and authors' achievement measures were rather weak.},

* Current functionalities of metagear include the following: an abstract screener GUI to efficiently sieve bibliographic information from large numbers of candidate studies; tools to assign screening effort across multiple collaborators/reviewers and to assess inter-reviewer reliability using kappa statistics; PDF downloader to automate the retrieval of journal articles from online data bases; automated data extractions from scatter-plots, box-plots and bar-plots; PRISMA flow diagrams; simple imputation tools to fill gaps in incomplete or missing study parameters; generation of random-effects sizes for Hedges' d, log response ratio, odds ratio and correlation coefficients for Monte Carlo experiments; covariance equations for modelling dependencies among multiple effect sizes (e.g. with a common control, phylogenetic correlations); and finally, summaries that replicate analyses and outputs from widely used but no longer updated meta-analysis software.

* Research synthesis practices are vital to many disciplines in the sciences, including ecology and evolutionary biology, and metagear aims to enrich the scope, quality and reproducibility of what can be achieved with the systematic review and meta-analysis of research outcomes.},

Studies, surveys and monitoring are often costly, especially offshore, so small investments in preliminary data collection and systematic planning of these activities can help to make best use of resources and inform trade-offs between budgets and expectations.

* To meet recognised needs for accessible tools to plan some aspects of studies, surveys and monitoring, we developed the R package emon. Emon includes routines for study design through power analysis (assuming independence of observations) and feature detection; which are the focus of this paper.

* We hope that access to the functions in emon, many drawing on work which was previously published but without code for implementation, will raise awareness of what marine studies, surveys and monitoring can achieve, thus encouraging cost-effective, needs- and evidence-based designs.},

  abstract = {* The exponential growth of scientific literature – which we call the ‘big literature’ phenomenon – has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesis methods to address this challenge.

* In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research.

* Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary research.

* Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.},

  abstract = {* The evolutionary dynamics of quantitative traits in a species depends on demographic structure (e.g. age- and size-dependent vital rates, migration across subpopulations, mate preferences, and the presence or absence of overlapping generations), which in turn can depend on interspecific interactions with other evolving species. Furthermore, biologists increasingly appreciate that evolutionary change in a single species can substantively affect broader ecological processes, such as community assembly and ecosystem functioning.

* Models integrating insights from classical population and quantitative genetics, on the one hand, and community ecology theory, on the other, are therefore critical to elucidating the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. However, few modelling approaches integrate ecological and genetic details into a comprehensive framework. Such models are needed to account for the reciprocal feedback between evolutionary change and ecological dynamics, and develop effective responses to anthropogenic disturbances on natural communities, improve agricultural practices and manage global health risks such as emerging pathogens.

* Here we introduce an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genetics simulator and framework for rapidly simulating eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our approach permits building models that can account for alternative genetic architectures, non-standard population dynamics and demographic structures, including those driven by interspecific interactions with other evolving species and the spatial dynamics of metacommunities. By integrating these processes into a common framework, we aim to facilitate the development of models that can further elucidate eco-evolutionary dynamics.

* While multi-species, forward-time population genetic models can be computationally expensive, we show how our framework leverages relatively economical graphics cards installed in modern desktops. We illustrate the versatility and general applicability of our approach for two very different case studies: antagonistic coevolution in space, and the evolution of life-history traits in response to resource dynamics in physiologically structured populations. We find that our analyses can run up to c. 200 times faster on a single commodity graphics card than on a single CPU core, comparable to the performance gains on small-to-medium sized computer clusters.

* Our approach therefore substantively reduces implementation difficulties to integrating ecological and evolutionary theory.},

  abstract = {* Phylogenetic signals are the legacy related to evolutionary processes shaping trait variation among species. Biologists can use these signals to tackle questions related to the evolutionary processes underlying trait evolution, estimate the ancestral state of a trait and predict unknown trait values from those of related species (i.e. ‘phylogenetic modelling’). Approaches to model phylogenetic signals rely on quantitative descriptors of the structures representing the consequences of evolution on trait differences among species.

* Here, we propose a novel framework to model phylogenetic signals: Phylogenetic Eigenvectors Maps (PEM). PEM are a set of eigenfunctions obtained from the structure of a phylogenetic graph, which can be a standard phylogenetic tree or a phylogenetic tree with added reticulations. These eigenfunctions depict a set of potential patterns of phenotype variation among species from the structure of the phylogenetic graph. A subset of eigenfunctions from a PEM is selected for the purpose of predicting the phenotypic values of traits for species that are represented in a tree, but for which trait data are otherwise lacking. This paper introduces a comprehensive view and the computational details of the PEM framework (with calculation examples), a simulation study to demonstrate the ability of PEM to predict trait values and four real data examples of the use of the framework.

* Simulation results show that PEM are robust in representing phylogenetic signal and in estimating trait values.

* The method also performed well when applied to the real-world data: prediction coefficients were high (0·76–0·88), and no notable model biases were found.

* Phylogenetic modelling using PEM is shown to be a useful methodological asset to disciplines such as ecology, ecophysiology, ecotoxicology, pharmaceutical botany, among others, which can benefit from estimating trait values that are laborious and often expensive to obtain.},

  abstract = {1. Current national and international frameworks for assessing threats to species have not been developed in the context of climate change, and are not framed in a way that recognises new opportunities that arise from climate change. 2. The framework presented here separates the threats and benefits of climate change for individual species. Threat is assessed by the level of climate-related decline within a species’ recently occupied (e.g. pre-1970s) historical distribution, based on observed (e.g. repeat census) and/or projected changes (e.g. modelled bioclimate space). Benefits are assessed in terms of observed and/or projected increases outside the recently occupied historical range. 3. Exacerbating factors (e.g. small population size, low dispersal capacity) that might increase levels of threat or limit expansion in response to climate change are taken into consideration within the framework. Protocols are also used to identify levels of confidence (and hence research and/or monitoring needs) in each species’ assessment. 4. Observed and projected changes are combined into single measures of expected decline and increase, together with associated measures of confidence. We weight risk classifications towards information that is most certain. Each species is then placed in one of six categories (high risk, medium risk, limited impact, equivalent risks \& benefits, medium benefit, high benefit) reflecting whether climate change is expected (or has been observed) to cause net declines or increases in the region considered, based on the balance of benefits and threats. 5. We illustrate the feasibility of using the framework by applying it to (i) all British butterflies (N~=~58 species) and (ii) an additional sample of British species: 18 species of plants, bats, birds and beetles. 6. Synthesis. Our framework assesses net declines and increases associated with climate change, for individual species. It could be applied at any scale (regional, continental or global distributions of species), and complements existing conservation assessment protocols such as red-listing. Using observed and projected population and/or range data, it is feasible to carry out systematic conservation status assessments that inform the development of monitoring, adaptation measures and conservation management planning for species that are responding to climate change.},

  abstract = {* Acoustic monitoring can be an efficient, cheap, non-invasive alternative to physical trapping of individuals. Spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) methods have been proposed to estimate calling animal abundance and density from data collected by a fixed array of microphones. However, these methods make some assumptions that are unlikely to hold in many situations, and the consequences of violating these are yet to be investigated.

* We generalize existing acoustic SECR methodology, enabling these methods to be used in a much wider variety of situations. We incorporate time-of-arrival (TOA) data collected by the microphone array, increasing the precision of calling animal density estimates. We use our method to estimate calling male density of the Cape Peninsula Moss Frog Arthroleptella lightfooti.

* Our method gives rise to an estimator of calling animal density that has negligible bias, and 95\% confidence intervals with appropriate coverage. We show that using TOA information can substantially improve estimate precision.

* Our analysis of the A.~lightfooti data provides the first statistically rigorous estimate of calling male density for an anuran population using a microphone array. This method fills a methodological gap in the monitoring of frog populations and is applicable to acoustic monitoring of other species that call or vocalize.},

The method rather easily gives what is usually searched for, i.e. an estimate of the role (or “weight”) of co-authors, as the additional value to an author papers’ popularity. The construction of the co-authorship popularity H-matrix is exemplified and the role of eigenvalues and the main eigenvector component are discussed. Examples illustrate the points and serve as the basis for suggesting a generally practical application of the concept.},

The ensuing inflationary and equalizing biases distort derived bibliometric measures of merit by systematically benefiting secondary authors at the expense of primary authors. Here I show how harmonic counting, which allocates credit according to authorship rank and the number of coauthors, provides simultaneous source-level correction for both biases as well as accommodating further decoding of byline information. I also demonstrate large and erratic effects of counting bias on the original h-index, and show how the harmonic version of the h-index provides unbiased bibliometric ranking of scientific merit while retaining the original's essential simplicity, transparency and intended fairness. Harmonic decoding of byline information resolves the conundrum of authorship credit allocation by providing a simple recipe for source-level correction of inflationary and equalizing bias. Harmonic counting could also offer unrivalled accuracy in automated assessments of scientific productivity, impact and achievement.},

  abstract = {An initial reading list is prepared by researchers at the start of literature review for getting an overview of the research performed in a particular area. Prior studies have taken the approach of merely recommending seminal or popular papers to aid researchers in such a task. In this paper, we present an alternative technique called the AKR (Author-specified Keywords based Retrieval) technique for providing popular, recent, survey and a diverse set of papers as a part of the initial reading list. The AKR technique is based on a novel coverage value that has its calculation centered on author-specified keywords. We performed an offline evaluation experiment with four variants of the AKR technique along with three state-of-the-art approaches involving collaborative filtering and graph ranking algorithms. Findings show that the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) enhanced variant of the AKR technique performs better than other techniques, satisfying most requirements for a reading list. A user evaluation study was conducted with 132 researchers to gauge user interest on the proposed technique using 14 evaluation measures. Results show that (i) students group are more satisfied with the recommended papers than staff group, (ii) popularity measure is strongly correlated with the output quality measures and (iii) the measures familiarity, usefulness and ‘agreeability on a good list’ were found to be strong predictors for user satisfaction. The AKR technique provides scope for extension in future information retrieval (IR) and content-based recommender systems (RS) studies.},

Typically, however, mapping and clustering techniques that are used together rely on very different ideas and assumptions. We propose a unified approach to mapping and clustering of bibliometric networks. We show that the VOS mapping technique and a weighted and parameterized variant of modularity-based clustering can both be derived from the same underlying principle. We illustrate our proposed approach by producing a combined mapping and clustering of the most frequently cited publications that appeared in the field of information science in the period 1999-2008.},

The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is also used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular 'Louvain algorithm' introduced by Blondel et al. (2008). The computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the literature.},

However, there is no consensus among researchers on which similarity measure is most appropriate for normalization purposes. In this article, we theoretically analyze the properties of similarity measures for cooccurrence data, focusing in particular on four well-known measures: the association strength, the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index. We also study the behavior of these measures empirically. Our analysis reveals that there exist two fundamentally different types of similarity measures, namely, set-theoretic measures and probabilistic measures. The association strength is a probabilistic measure, while the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index are set-theoretic measures. Both our theoretical and our empirical results indicate that cooccurrence data can best be normalized using a probabilistic measure. This provides strong support for the use of the association strength in scientometric research.},

  abstract = {Payments for environmental services (PES) have attracted increasing interest as a mechanism to translate external, non-market values of the environment into real financial incentives for local actors to provide environmental services (ES). In this introductory paper, we set the stage for the rest of this Special Issue of Ecological Economics by reviewing the main issues arising in PES design and implementation and discussing these in the light of environmental economics. We start with a discussion of PES definition and scope. We proceed to review some of the principal dimensions and design characteristics of PES programs and then analyze how PES compares to alternative policy instruments. Finally, we examine in detail two important aspects of PES programs: their effectiveness and their distributional implications. PES is not a silver bullet that can be used to address any environmental problem, but a tool tailored to address a specific set of problems: those in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of ecosystem managers. PES is based on the beneficiary-pays rather than the polluter-pays principle, and as such is attractive in settings where ES providers are poor, marginalized landholders or powerful groups of actors. An important distinction within PES is between user-financed PES in which the buyers are the users of the ES, and government-financed PES in which the buyers are others (typically the government) acting on behalf of ES users. In practice, PES programs differ in the type and scale of ES demand, the payment source, the type of activity paid for, the performance measure used, as well as the payment mode and amount. The effectiveness and efficiency of PES depends crucially on program design.},
